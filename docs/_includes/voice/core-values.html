  <h3>Less, but better</h3>
  <p class="small">Weniger, aber besser (Dieter Rams)</p>
  <p>Strive for simplicity. The communicator, not the receiver, should do the work.</p>

  <h3>By the people, for the people</h3>
  <p class="small">بالشعب و للشعب Bil-shaʿb wa lil-shaʿb</p>
  <p>We democratize translation, making it convenient and accessible to all. We’re here to improve the lives of everyone at Gengo—customers, translators and staff alike.</p>

  <h3>Continuous improvement</h3>
  <p class="small">改善 Kaizen</p>
  <p>As we work, we improve how we work. This is about listening, observation, research and defining standards, then improving on those standards to scale.</p>

  <h3>What is essential in war is victory, not prolonged operations</h3>
  <p class="small">故兵貴勝，不貴久 Gù bīng guì shèng, bù guì jiǔ (Sun Tzu)</p>
  <p>Everyone is focused on our mission, so we reduce bureaucracy. All actions, conversations and messages have purpose.</p>

  <h3>Click. Boom. Amazing!</h3>
  <p class="small">(Steve Jobs)</p>
  <p>Our job is to create experiences that are truly exceptional, memorable and game-changing. At every step we should be thinking, “Am I doing amazing work here?” Truly amazing things aren't quick and flashy, but are solid and take years of hard work.</p>
