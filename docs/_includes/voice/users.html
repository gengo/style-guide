  <h1>Users</h1>
  <hr/>

  <p>All users are important, and our communications should reflect this. If you’re talking about system-wide changes, say “improve your Gengo experience” or “improve the user experience,” not “improve the customer experience.”</p>

      <h2>Our <span class="customer">customers</span> are:</h2>
      <h3 class="customer">Diverse</h3>
      <p>They are a mix of individuals, localization project managers, marketing professionals and product staff looking to translate a wide range of content (personal letters, user-generated reviews, product descriptions, etc.). They come from many countries and industries. Some are deeply familiar with translation processes and others are translating for the first time.</p>

      <h3 class="customer">Strategic</h3>
      <p>They are searching for an affordable, effective, and efficient alternative to a traditionally expensive and cumbersome process. They make informed decisions based on the intersection of speed, scale, quality, and cost.</p>

      <h3 class="customer">Busy</h3>
      <p>They believe in getting things done and dislike unnecessary distractions. They value tools that work well and information that is useful.</p>

      <p>They are highly proficient in at least two languages and have talent for the written word. They are self-starters, always seeking opportunities to learn and grow. They are proud professionals with a purpose, are tech-savvy, and time-conscious.</p>

      <h3 class="translator">Values-driven</h3>
      <p>They view translating with Gengo as more than a job; it is an opportunity to collaborate with language specialists from around the world, develop translation skills, and help others do the same. They appreciate our fun and friendly atmosphere, and feel part of our community with a stake in Gengo’s growth.</p>
