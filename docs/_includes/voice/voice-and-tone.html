  <h1>Voice and tone</h1>
  <hr/>

  <p>Getting the right tone of voice means Gengo customers recognize us as an efficient and solid service and authority on globalization, localization and translation. For translators, it means we are seen as a fair and reliable company and the definitive place to grow as a language enthusiast.</p>

      <h3>Simple</h3>
      <p>We use clear, straightforward messaging with a human touch. Avoid ambiguity, jargon, and complex wording. Be concise—tap the power of brevity, channel Dieter Rams and strive for simplicity.</p>

      <h3>Human</h3>
      <p>Our human element sets us apart and our voice should reflect this. Language should be informal and familiar, active not passive and second rather than third person (e.g., “you” instead of “translators”; “you can publish all your content” instead of “ecommerce, travel and media companies can publish all their content”). If we make a mistake, we acknowledge it, own it and apologize.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
      <h3>Credible</h3>
      <p>Our voice is authoritative, but not dictatorial. We are serious about our mission, and occasionally show our fun side—when appropriate; system errors or payment failure are not laughing matters. We are passionate about breaking down language barriers, but not in a way that’s excitable or immature (i.e. keep emoticons and exclamation marks to a minimum!!!)</p>

      <h3>International</h3>
      <p>Gengo does not belong to any one country or culture. Our customers, translators and staff come from all corners of the earth and many speak more than one language. We are culturally sensitive, and maintain a strong sense of identity across all languages.</p>
